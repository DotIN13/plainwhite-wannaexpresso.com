<p>God would not punish you because he knew you would always do that to yourself.</p>
<p>Sargent Shroom said in the film <em>Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk</em> that there is always something looking at you from above.</p>
<p>You would not know what that is nor who that could be. He could be Jesus, he could be Śākyamuni, he could be anything. But he is just somrthing biggier than us. It is more like some pattern, or a myth with varying answers. We live under that and there is no way out of it.</p>
<p>Whenever he interferes, he does not do it directly, instead he puts you in a maze, where you decide, where you make hard decisions to turn left or right. You fall easily. For your own lust uncontrolled and shortsightedness yet not remedied, you fall.</p>
<p>He knew you would always do that to yourself.</p>
