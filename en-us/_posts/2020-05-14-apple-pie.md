## Preparation

Since my oven is broken, probably due to the influence of big data, the kitchen app recommended me an apple pie recipe that doesn't require an oven. Well, in that case, I'll try it out myself.

The ingredients are simple:

+ 1 apple
+ 1 Chinese pancake 
+ 3 spoons of sugar
+ 2 spoons of starch
+ A little oil

## Instructions

### 1. First, peel the apple

### 3. Add some oil, stir-fry it until soft, then add sugar, stir until transparent (smell the apple fragrance!)

Ideally, you should wrap them individually to look nice, like the picture below. But I opted for convenience and wrapped a large dumpling.

### 5. Fry both sides in a frying pan until golden brown
