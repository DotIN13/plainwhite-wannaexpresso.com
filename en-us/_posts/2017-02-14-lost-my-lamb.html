<p>Just lost my lovely little lamb given to me by accident two years ago. God please forgive me.
    I somehow starts to believe that it was fate to let me have it, and also fate to let me lose it. I tried to fill my
    mind up with the story of a fiery bunny swallowing a lovely lamb, which obviously didn&#39;t do the job. So I&#39;ve
    done the search but found nothing. Probably God has just gave it to someone else, I believe it.</p>
