<p>Gone for sailing yesterday, chat with the sailor on the boat about the Holy Cross on Boracay,
    I got to know that Christians are pretty common on this island. He asked me whether i was one, when I told him that
    I believe that there is a God but I was no Christian. He seems to be very impressed and he promised to come to
    Shanghai later on. It's soul bound I guess. I was touched from deep heart.</p>
