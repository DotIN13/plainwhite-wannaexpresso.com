![Beach in Boracay](/img/in-post/post-boracay/beach.jpg)
<p>Beautiful days in Boracay. Bukos, known as coconuts, here are as cool as the ones in
    Hainan. The sand on the beach here is white as milk. The sky is purely blue. Good news, no air-pollution! Maybe my
    nose would get better. LoL.</p>
