## Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
You're the one that I've been waiting for  
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna  
Heal me if I don't open the door  
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me  


[Refrain]  
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)  
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)  
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out  
Look at me now  


[Pre-Chorus]  
'Cause all I ever wanted was love  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah  
All I ever wanted was love  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)  


[Chorus]  
I want your stupid love, love  
I want your stupid love, love  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  


[Verse 2]  
Now, it's time to free me from the shame  
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or  
Could this love protect me from the pain?  
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)  


[Refrain]  
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)  
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)  
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out  
Look at me now  


[Pre-Chorus]  
'Cause all I ever wanted was love  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah  
All I ever wanted was love  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)  
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)  


[Chorus]  
I want your stupid love, love  
I want your stupid love, love  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  


[Bridge]  
I don't need a reason (Oh)  
Not sorry, I want your stupid love  
I don't need a reason (Oh)  
Not sorry, I want your stupid love  
Hey yeah, hey yeah  


[Chorus]  
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)  
We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I want your stupid love, love  
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I want your stupid love, love
