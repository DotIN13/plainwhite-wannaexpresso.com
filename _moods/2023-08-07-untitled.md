Dear Wulaoshi and Malaoshi,

At first I didn’t realize what kind of experience I am going to have in Xi’an. I thought I was looking for an ancient King’s land, or an an escape from city life, or a feast of snacks and specialties. Then I was lost for a day or two - I had none of those coming.

But now when I look back sitting in the plane seat, I realized it was an experience of hospitality, love and most important of all, family. Thank you for having me back, back at home.

Peter
