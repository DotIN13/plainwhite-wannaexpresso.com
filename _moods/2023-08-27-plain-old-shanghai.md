It should have been a common ground,  
that the city we are born into,  
can never possibly match  
the exotic beauty  
of the outside world.

Yet for the first time  
I'm riding along  
the bank of River Suzhou.

The gentle breeze, the brick walls,  
the solemn, yet elegant yellow lights.

I was reluctant.

I refuse to admit,  
that it is the city -  
the city I was born into,  
the plain old Shanghai.
